0,What strategies can a company use to manage capital amid market limits and debt rules?,"[' Related to Financing and Transactional Factors\nWe may require additional capital, which may not be available on terms acceptable to us or at all.\nHistorically, we funded our capital-intensive operations and capital expenditures primarily through equity issuances and cash generated from our\noperations. To support our growing business, we must have sufficient capital to continue to make significant investments in our offerings, including potential\nnew offerings. In November 2022, we entered into a $420.0\xa0million revolving credit agreement, in May 2020, we issued $747.5\xa0million in aggregate principal\namount of our 2025 Notes and, from time to time, we may seek additional equity or debt financing, including by the issuance of securities, to finance our\noperations and growth or to refinance our existing indebtedness, among other things. If we raise additional funds through the issuance of equity, equity-linked\nor debt securities, such as our 2025 Notes, those securities may have rights, preferences or privileges senior to those of our Class A common stock, and our\nexisting stockholders may experience dilution. Further, we have secured debt financing which has resulted in fixed obligations and certain restrictive\ncovenants, and any debt financing secured by us in the future would result in increased fixed obligations and could involve additional restrictive covenants\nrelating to our capital-raising activities and other financial and\n45\n', ' cash flow from\noperations in the future sufficient to service our debt and make necessary capital expenditures. If we are unable to generate such cash flow, we may be required\nto adopt one or more alternatives, such as selling assets, restructuring debt or obtaining additional debt financing or equity capital on terms that may be onerous\nor highly dilutive. Our ability to refinance any existing or future indebtedness will depend on the capital markets, general macroeconomic conditions and our\nfinancial condition at such time. We may not be able to engage in any of these activities or engage in these activities on desirable terms, which could result in a\ndefault on our debt obligations. Events and circumstances may also occur which would cause us to not be able to satisfy applicable draw-down conditions and\nutilize our revolving credit facility. In addition, any of our future debt agreements may contain restrictive covenants that may prohibit us from adopting any of\nthese alternatives. Our failure to comply with these covenants could result in an event of default which, if not cured or waived, could result in the acceleration\nof our debt.\nIn addition, our indebtedness, combined with our other financial obligations and contractual commitments, could have other important consequences.\nFor example, it could:\n47\n']",The answer to given question is not present in context,multi_context,"[{'source': 'docs/lyft.pdf', 'file_path': 'docs/lyft.pdf', 'page': 44, 'total_pages': 143, 'format': 'PDF 1.4', 'title': '0001759509-24-000019', 'author': 'EDGAR® Online LLC, a subsidiary of OTC Markets Group', 'subject': 'Form 10-K filed on 2024-02-20 for the period ending 2023-12-31', 'keywords': '0001759509-24-000019; ; 10-K', 'creator': 'EDGAR Filing HTML Converter', 'producer': 'EDGRpdf Service w/ EO.Pdf 22.0.40.0', 'creationDate': ""D:20240220060533-05'00'"", 'modDate': ""D:20240220060544-05'00'"", 'trapped': '', 'encryption': 'Standard V2 R3 128-bit RC4'}, {'source': 'docs/lyft.pdf', 'file_path': 'docs/lyft.pdf', 'page': 46, 'total_pages': 143, 'format': 'PDF 1.4', 'title': '0001759509-24-000019', 'author': 'EDGAR® Online LLC, a subsidiary of OTC Markets Group', 'subject': 'Form 10-K filed on 2024-02-20 for the period ending 2023-12-31', 'keywords': '0001759509-24-000019; ; 10-K', 'creator': 'EDGAR Filing HTML Converter', 'producer': 'EDGRpdf Service w/ EO.Pdf 22.0.40.0', 'creationDate': ""D:20240220060533-05'00'"", 'modDate': ""D:20240220060544-05'00'"", 'trapped': '', 'encryption': 'Standard V2 R3 128-bit RC4'}]",True

The state net operating loss carryovers will begin\nto expire in 2024 and will continue to expire at various times depending upon individual state carryforward rules. Utilization of the net operating loss\ncarryforwards are subject to various limitations including the ownership change limitations provided by Internal Revenue Code (IRC) Section\xa0382 and similar\nstate provisions.\nThe Company is subject to taxation in the United States and various foreign jurisdictions.

The Clerical Error is unrelated to our internal control over financial reporting. In\norder to remediate the deficiency, we will design and implement additional review procedures over forward-looking directional commentary. As of February\n20, 2024, we believe that the actions we have taken, and plan to take, will remediate this deficiency.\nManagement’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and\n15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act). Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of\nour financial reporting and the preparation of consolidated financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting\nprinciples.\nOur management, under the supervision of our Chief Financial Officer and Chief Accounting Officer, conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of\nour internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023 based on the framework in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013), issued by the\nCommittee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on this evaluation, management concluded that our internal control over\nfinancial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2023.\nThe effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023 has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an\nindependent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report, which is included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nChanges in Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nThere have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting identified in management’s evaluation pursuant to Rules 13a-15(d) or 15d-\n15(d) of the Exchange Act during the fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2023 that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal\ncontrol over financial reporting.\nLimitations on Effectiveness of Controls and Procedures\nOur management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, do not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or\nour internal control over financial reporting will prevent all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only\nreasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are\nresource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no\nevaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. These inherent limitations\ninclude the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of a simple error or mistake. Additionally,\ncontrols can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people or by management override of the controls. The\ndesign of any system of controls is also based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any\ndesign will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions; over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in\nconditions, or the degree of compliance with policies or procedures may deteriorate. Due to inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system,\nmisstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.\nItem 9B.

Ineffective disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting could also cause errors in\nour reporting. For example, our management determined that the recent clerical error in our forward-looking, non-GAAP directional commentary for fiscal\nyear 2024 contained in our initial press release issued on February 13, 2024 resulted in the conclusion that our disclosure controls and procedures were not\neffective as of December 31, 2023 at a reasonable assurance level. Failure of our disclosure controls and procedures or internal control over financial reporting\nto be effective could cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial and other information, which would likely adversely affect the market price of\nour Class A common stock. In addition, if we are unable to continue to meet these requirements, we may not be able to remain listed on the Nasdaq Global\nSelect Market.\n43\n', 'Item 9. Changes in and Disagreements With Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure.\nNone.\nItem 9A. Controls and Procedures.\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nOur management, with the participation of our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of our\ndisclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act),\nas of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Based on such evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial\nofficer have concluded that as of December 31, 2023, due to a deficiency related to the review of our forward-looking, non-GAAP directional commentary for\nfiscal year 2024 that resulted in a clerical error (the “Clerical Error”) in our press release announcing our financial results for the fourth quarter and fiscal year\n2023 which was furnished with our Current Report on Form 8-K dated February 13, 2024, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective at a\nreasonable assurance level.\nThe Clerical Error was promptly corrected on our earnings call and in an updated press release and supplemental slides on February 13, 2024 and in\nan amendment to the Form 8-K filed with the SEC on February 14, 2024. The Clerical Error is unrelated to our internal control over financial reporting. In\norder to remediate the deficiency, we will design and implement additional review procedures over forward-looking directional commentary. As of February\n20, 2024, we believe that the actions we have taken, and plan to take, will remediate this deficiency.\nManagement’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and\n15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act). Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of\nour financial reporting and the preparation of consolidated financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting\nprinciples.\nOur management, under the supervision of our Chief Financial Officer and Chief Accounting Officer, conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of\nour internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023 based on the framework in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013), issued by the\nCommittee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on this evaluation, management concluded that our internal control over\nfinancial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2023.\nThe effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023 has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an\nindependent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report, which is included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nChanges in Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nThere have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting identified in management’s evaluation pursuant to Rules 13a-15(d) or 15d-\n15(d) of the Exchange Act during the fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2023 that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal\ncontrol over financial reporting.\nLimitations on Effectiveness of Controls and Procedures\nOur management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, do not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or\nour internal control over financial reporting will prevent all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only\nreasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are\nresource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no\nevaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. These inherent limitations\ninclude the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of a simple error or mistake. Additionally,\ncontrols can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people or by management override of the controls. The\ndesign of any system of controls is also based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any\ndesign will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions; over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in\nconditions, or the degree of compliance with policies or procedures may deteriorate. Due to inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system,\nmisstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.\nItem 9B.

6,"How could stock comp expenses, driver retention, and market ops affect the company's financial stability?","['•\nright-size our real estate portfolio.\nIf we fail to address the risks and difficulties that we face, including those associated with the challenges listed above as well as those described\nelsewhere in this “Risk Factors” section, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. Further, because we have an\nevolving financial model and operate in a rapidly evolving market, any predictions about our future gross bookings, revenue, expenses and earnings may not be\nas accurate as they would be if we had a static financial model or operated in a more predictable market. We have encountered in the past, and will encounter in\nthe future, risks and uncertainties frequently experienced by growing companies with limited operating histories in rapidly changing industries. If our\nassumptions regarding these risks and uncertainties, which we use to plan and operate our business, are incorrect or change, or if we do not address these risks\nsuccessfully, our results of operations could differ materially from our expectations and our business, financial condition and results of operations could be\nadversely affected.\nOur financial performance in recent periods may not be indicative of future performance, and we may not be able to achieve or maintain profitability in\nthe future.\nPrior to COVID-19, we grew rapidly. In 2020, due to COVID-19 and the related government and public health measures, our revenue declined\nsignificantly. Although our revenue has since recovered, the timeline for a full recovery of rideshare demand, driver supply and other aspects of our business in\neach of our markets is uncertain. Accordingly, our recent revenue growth rate and financial performance, including prior to the effects of COVID-19, the\ndecline related to COVID-19 and recent growth rates compared to periods in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic, may not be indicative of our future\nperformance. Further, we have incurred net losses each year since our inception, and we expect that our financial performance, including Adjusted EBITDA,\nwill continue to fluctuate in future periods. We can provide no assurances that we will achieve or maintain Adjusted EBITDA profitability in the future, on a\nquarterly or annual basis, or that we will ever achieve profitability on a GAAP basis.\nWhile we remain focused on operating efficiently, our expenses will likely increase in the future as we develop and launch new offerings and platform\nfeatures, expand in existing and new markets and continue to invest in our platform and customer engagement. In addition, certain costs, such as insurance and\ndriver pay and incentives have increased or fluctuated as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, macroeconomic factors and the development and maturation of\nour business and the rideshare industry and may continue to do so. We may be unable to accurately predict these costs and our investments may not result in\nincreased revenue or growth in our business. For example, we have incurred and will continue to incur additional costs and expenses associated with the\npassage of Proposition 22 in California, HB 2076 in Washington and implementation of operational changes as part of an agreement with the New York\nAttorney General, including providing drivers in these states with new earnings opportunities and protections, including contributions towards on-the-job injury\ninsurance, other benefits and minimum guaranteed earnings. In addition, various jurisdictions have introduced legislation setting high earnings standards and\nincreasing other costs to the business including insurance. Due to various factors, including inflation, we anticipate that our insurance costs will continue to\nincrease and will impact our profitability. Furthermore, we have expanded over time to include more asset-intensive offerings such as our network of Light\nVehicles and Flexdrive. These offerings and programs require significant capital investments and recurring costs, including debt payments, maintenance,\ndepreciation, asset life and asset replacement costs, and if we are not able to maintain sufficient levels of utilization of such assets, such offerings are otherwise\nnot successful or we decide to shut down any such offerings, our investments may not generate sufficient returns and our financial condition may be adversely\naffected. In addition to the above, a determination in, resolution of, or settlement of, any legal proceeding related to driver classification matters may require us\nto significantly alter our existing business model and operations (including potentially suspending or ceasing operations in impacted jurisdictions), increase our\ncosts and impact our ability to add qualified drivers to our platform and grow our business, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial\ncondition and results of operations, and our ability to achieve or maintain profitability in the future. Additionally, stock-based compensation expense related to\nRSUs and other equity awards is expected to continue to be a significant expense for the foreseeable future, and as of December 31, 2023, we had $203.1\nmillion of unrecognized stock-based compensation expense related to all unvested awards, net of estimated forfeitures, that will be recognized over a weighted-\naverage period of approximately 1.2 years. Any failure to increase our revenue', 'markets in which we operate and the performance of our offerings, and we have discontinued and may in the future discontinue operations in certain markets as\na result of such evaluations. For example, we now offer Shared Rides exclusively in connection with business-to-business partnerships and only in select\nmarkets. Any of the foregoing risks and challenges could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf we fail to cost-effectively attract and retain qualified drivers on our platform, or to increase the utilization of our platform by existing drivers, our\nbusiness, financial condition and results of operations could be harmed.\nOur continued growth depends in part on our ability to cost-effectively attract and retain qualified drivers who satisfy our screening criteria and\nprocedures and to increase their utilization of our platform. To attract and retain qualified drivers, we have, among other things, offered\xa0sign-up\xa0and referral\nbonuses and provided access to third-party vehicle rental programs for drivers who do not have or do not wish to use their own vehicle. Drivers are generally\nable to switch between our platform and competing platforms. If we do not continue to provide drivers with flexibility on our platform, compelling\nopportunities to increase earnings and other incentive programs, such as demand-based bonuses, that are comparable or superior to those of our competitors\nand other companies in the app-based work industry or other industries, or if drivers become dissatisfied with our programs and benefits or our requirements\nfor drivers, including requirements regarding the vehicles they drive, we may fail to attract new drivers, retain current drivers or increase their utilization of our\nplatform, or we may experience complaints, negative publicity, strikes or other work stoppages that could adversely affect our users and our business. For\nexample, during the COVID-19 pandemic, we experienced a shortage of available drivers relative to rider demand in certain markets and offered increased\nincentives to improve driver supply. Our revenue and results of operations have in prior periods been negatively impacted by supply incentives, and to the\nextent that driver availability remains limited and we offer increased incentives to improve supply, our revenue and results of operations may be negatively\nimpacted in the future. Additionally, following the passage of Proposition 22 in California, drivers have been able to access the earning opportunities described\nin the ballot measure. In addition, in connection with a settlement with the New York Attorney General, the Company will implement certain operational\nchanges that may entail increased costs. Further, other jurisdictions may adopt similar laws and regulations, which would likely increase our expenses. Ongoing\nlitigation seeking to reclassify drivers as employees is pending in multiple jurisdictions, including as described in the “Legal Proceedings” subheading in Note\n9, Commitments and Contingencies to the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. If such litigation is successful in one\nor more jurisdictions, we may be required to classify drivers as employees rather than independent contractors in those jurisdictions, and we may incur\nsignificant expenses to resolve the matters at issue in the litigation. If this occurs, we may need to develop and implement an employment model that we have\nnot historically used or to cease operations, whether temporarily or permanently, in affected jurisdictions. We may face specific risks relating to our ability to\nonboard drivers as employees, our ability to partner with third-party organizations to source drivers and our ability to effectively utilize employee drivers to\nmeet rider demand.\nIf drivers are unsatisfied with our partners, including our third-party vehicle rental partners, our ability to attract and retain qualified drivers and to\nincrease their utilization of our platform could be adversely affected. Further, incentives we provide to attract drivers could fail to attract and retain qualified\ndrivers or fail to increase utilization, or could have other unintended adverse consequences. In addition, changes in certain laws and regulations, including\nimmigration, labor and employment laws or background check requirements, may result in a shift or decrease in the pool of qualified drivers, which may result\nin increased competition for qualified drivers or higher costs of recruitment, operation and retention. As part of our business operations or research and\ndevelopment efforts, data on the vehicle may be collected and drivers may be uncomfortable or unwilling to drive knowing that data is being collected. Other\nfactors outside of our control, such as concerns about personal health and safety, increases in the price of gasoline, vehicles or insurance, or concerns about the\navailability of government or other assistance programs if drivers continue to drive on our platform, may also reduce the number of drivers on our platform or\ntheir utilization of our platform, or impact our ability to onboard new drivers. If we fail to attract qualified drivers on favorable terms, fail to increase their\nutilization of our platform or lose qualified drivers to our competitors, we may not be able to meet the demand of riders, including maintaining a competitive\nprice of rides to riders, and our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nIf we fail to cost-effect']","Stock-based compensation expenses are expected to continue to be a significant expense for the foreseeable future, with $203.1 million of unrecognized stock-based compensation expense related to all unvested awards as of December 31, 2023.

The funds served as collateral for us and our subsidiary’s current and future claim settlement obligations\xa0under the indemnification agreements\nfor these insurance policies as included in insurance reserves on the consolidated balance sheet. Accordingly, the amount withdrawn was presented as collateral\nheld by insurer on the consolidated balance sheet.\nDuring the third quarter of 2021, in connection with the legacy auto insurance transfer as described below, James River returned funds, previously presented as\ncollateral held by insurer, to the trust account where the funds were previously held. Accordingly, the funds were reclassified from collateral held by insurer to non-\ncurrent restricted cash and cash equivalents on our consolidated balance sheet as of December\xa031, 2021.\nLegacy Auto Insurance Transfer\nOn September 27, 2021, Aleka Insurance, Inc., our wholly-owned captive insurance subsidiary, entered into a Loss Portfolio Transfer Reinsurance Agreement\n(the “LPTA”) with James River effective July 1, 2021. Pursuant to the LPTA, our captive insurance subsidiary reinsured certain automobile liability insurance risks\nrelating to activity on our platform between 2013 and 2019 in exchange for payment by James River to our captive insurance subsidiary of a premium in the\namount of $345 million (“Premium”). Subsequent to the LPTA, we retain substantially all of the liabilities on these policies when taken together with previous risk\ntransfer arrangements. In connection with the LPTA, claims administered by James River were transferred to a third-party claims administrator for ongoing\nhandling (the “Transferred Claims”) at our expense. The liabilities associated with the Transferred Claims were re-evaluated as of September 30, 2021, and adverse\ndevelopment was recognized on certain of those liabilities.
